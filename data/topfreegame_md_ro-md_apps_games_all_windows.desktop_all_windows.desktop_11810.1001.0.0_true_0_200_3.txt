Bring down your wrath in an amazing mission with varied enemies. Become the last line of defense in a sci-fi world of epic proportions. Enemies are everywhere and you must defeat every last one in order to claim the title as ultimate victor. \r\n\r\n??Time is running out...??\r\n\r\nI am a prisoner on a planet in a galaxy devoid of human life. I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed.

On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NZS1WR0N380","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toy Blast Mania","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59555.14470234918747483.44a8e14c-4fb8-4a13-a423-5094a6416fcc.64948d9d-3aae-4315-9408-90ce0b3af9a6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7278.14470234918747483.5bdf7aae-8f16-4712-963e-aa7bc0ae4236.8c0c5c46-44f8-480e-9c52-8b229fd6b92e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59555.14470234918747483.44a8e14c-4fb8-4a13-a423-5094a6416fcc.64948d9d-3aae-4315-9408-90ce0b3af9a6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["5895BlastCrushGames.ToyBlastMania_f1613047p3868"],"ContentIds":["b4461e86-5769-b42c-c6e3-67ff10678faf"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THE ULTIMATE MATCHING PUZZLE GAME WITH UNIQUE MAGIC POWERS AND BOOSTS!\r\n\r\n♥ Join the fun world of Amy and help collect her precious toys! ♥ \r\n\r\nMatch two or more blocks of the same color to clear the level and collect the toys from where they stuck.

For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P44QQ1JLZNS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Real Pool 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31735.14599956776301907.890659bd-1820-4a5d-a91d-3d08f97172e2.14439ad2-aa15-4378-82ce-837b67e305bb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31547.14599956776301907.5e1392cd-424f-4342-9b4a-a03eb05d27f7.54da2a01-5b8a-423f-b1e7-e1d45cd09107","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39479.14599956776301907.1f72749e-8abb-4eef-ad53-ac618a578f08.f6c5d2ad-89d8-4e9b-869d-790ce4d02196","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56869.14599956776301907.60fa3030-1651-4e6b-938b-d300462e7177.9b518ab0-1038-464f-8047-6e05365ba9bc","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["B9BA84AC.RealPool3D_3ag0hv5nd203a"],"ContentIds":["2c745c5d-72f7-96b8-60e2-46fd5eb3e8e8","4f4bc14f-1e96-5f9b-0918-27836d63852a","1d826eb6-07a3-d4b4-6f24-6efdc0144cba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The world`s best snooker and 8 ball pool game on Windows!😎👏🏻\r\n\r\nPlay with friends!

Enjoy hours of entertainment with our version with 3 games in one – traditional Backgammon, Narde and Fevga. \r\nBackgammon is one of the oldest board games known. It is a two player game where playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. \r\n\r\nThe roll of the dice indicates how many points, the player is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward. The following rules apply:\r\n- The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another (or same) checker three spaces to an open point.\r\n- A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use.\r\n- A player must use both (or all 4 for doubles) numbers of a roll if this is legally possible. When only one number can be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can be played but not both, the player must play the larger one.\r\n- Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home board, he may commence bearing off. A player bears off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker resides, and then removing that checker from the board. If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, you must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, you must remove a checker from the highest point that has a checker.\r\n\r\nFevga First checker away\r\nYour first checker must pass the opponent's starting point before you may move any of your other checkers. \r\n\r\nBackGammon Hitting\r\nIf an opposing checker lands on a spot occupied by a single checker, this checker is placed on the bar. Any time a player has checkers on the bar, his first obligation is to enter those checker(s) into the opposing home board by moving it to an open point corresponding to one of the numbers on the rolled dice. \r\n\r\nNarde/Fevga Primes\r\nYou may not build a prime (six consecutive blocks) in front of all of the opponent's checkers; at least one opposing checker must be in front of your prime.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P4SQB0WJDMT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snooker Stars Billiard","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23607.14587084993034324.435323ab-9e56-4c40-bcc4-6c8794fd7da1.2d4d0b77-424a-4117-a51d-792aecaeb221","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61452.14587084993034324.a666e82f-f611-4958-8dab-50f30c185eda.53dfffe3-341f-4cdb-918e-875df421bee3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23607.14587084993034324.435323ab-9e56-4c40-bcc4-6c8794fd7da1.2d4d0b77-424a-4117-a51d-792aecaeb221","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["12262FiveStarGames.SnookerStarsBilliard_s5tp8gve928er"],"ContentIds":["5979d7e8-3bd6-cc20-20d7-0106fadf2e3e","f36ec444-dd5b-d23b-7e65-e485fd9a875a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Snooker Stars Billiard is the world’s Best ONLINE POOL Game!\r\nTry out the most realistic Snooker Stars on Windows Store!

Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are \"singles\" (with one player per side) and \"doubles\" (with two players per side).

If so, then Tank Ace Free could be the game for you. \r\n\r\nThe goal of each round of play is to clear the enemy from a map sector and drive them off the far bank of a river so that your side can cross and advance. Skills you will need to accomplish this are a working trigger finger, the ability to navigate east or west, and driving ability sufficient to crash into other vehicles. \r\n\r\nA status panel shows the number of enemies left, rounds remaining, fuel, and armor strength. The last three can be replenished by ramming (not shooting) an enemy truck. If you run out of fuel or armor, or for some reason drive your tank into the water, in addition to an untimely death you will be forced to retreat one sector. If you wipe out the enemies you will advance one sector, retaining any excess supplies you have scavenged. The game ends when you take the enemy capitol, or they overrun yours. Either way the brass will want to have a talk with you. \r\n\r\nThis free version plays one level of the full game, Tank Ace Reloaded, and contains advertising.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCMMN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kids Preschool Learning Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10044.9007199266370181.27bec389-ec52-4eea-975f-786c3374b8a2.262f5e9a-eb7d-4b87-9f14-29ef5205a71b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51411.9007199266370181.2a5af2bf-a669-4097-9e74-092c6bca6f2a.4b196d32-60bb-4bfc-aab4-43ee95b92aed","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49461.9007199266370181.db493b66-7fc6-4f3c-add3-12eecd8ad641.6a28db40-7353-4af4-9801-70914edb3091","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2536.9007199266370181.47eb8b60-0fc0-4a0f-a956-2bd7e4dcba21.b90bac54-ef6c-458f-a06d-b1beefe7ffbb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25476.9007199266370181.9171c2e3-f034-4199-a4d0-1ba355bb6a30.c1e6e62a-708f-4627-8279-9579f671f6ae","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38912.9007199266370181.bfb6ff84-b1d4-47f0-adf7-772fb3e3de13.d021da6e-ea72-4883-bacd-9f380a7c339b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["greysprings.GSPreschoolGames_p4xj81aw0mjbg"],"ContentIds":["cd72ef9a-ff32-ee22-ac0a-c3e6036becf8","6f03bc25-ab47-e427-1cc5-c3399721515a","425e77c5-e946-5d3e-e50e-d05c42624cbe","04d630a0-ab96-57a7-6b6c-6b106a89c499"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A beautiful app, designed for kids in the age range 3 to 6, to foster their learning, imagination and free play.

Your customers will place pizza orders that you must build and serve before the time runs out. Use ingredients to build the perfect pizzas and get paid money by your happy clients! Finish the pizzas and earn enough money to move on to the next day. Fail, and you lose your job!\r\n\r\nIn Pizza Chef, there are two modes of play: Career Mode and Time Attack. In Career Mode, you must earn one hundred dollars each day in order to progress on to the next day. As you progress, the levels become harder as more ingredients are added to the pizzas, and the orders start to get more and more out of control. Keep your customers happy! Career Mode contains a total of 50 levels for non stop fun and family friendly action.\r\n\r\nTime Attack mode is unlocked by reaching day 10 in Career Mode. In Time Attack mode you are given 20 seconds to build as many pizzas as you can. Each time you complete an order, you get 10 more seconds added to the clock. Pound out pizzas as fast as you can and see how much money you can make!\r\n\r\nPizza Chef is an entertaining game of skill, wit, reflexes, memorization, and time management. It is a fun game for kids and adults of all ages. I am always improving my games and looking to add more content, so please leave me suggestions on how I can make the game better!

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCJB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ultima 4 in a Row","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10718.9007199266251681.5f451dc5-31a9-4c3f-9cd6-d2541133600c.49f928c5-2818-4c96-99e7-0345e5552db9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50866.9007199266251681.e7ebff8d-40dd-41ef-a3f7-7dd9a2c15a43.7ae7ca5d-c0f7-49be-902b-7cb850f41304","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11981.9007199266251681.dbb59175-db2f-43be-9a39-9d474efb7caa.687fc77a-7f4e-4319-a84e-1ab4679caa41","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53045.9007199266251681.410024ea-04a1-418a-87f5-d6e448ced0e6.7b76b2b4-5e42-487f-8a75-25ca3db8888d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10718.9007199266251681.5f451dc5-31a9-4c3f-9cd6-d2541133600c.49f928c5-2818-4c96-99e7-0345e5552db9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["77FB73B9.Ultima4inaRow_s4j7f2dav3hk4"],"ContentIds":["f8d0e02a-7b78-8bba-0991-9be37d511ae3","af305a49-b6a4-fcac-faf1-fcd77b04b6b5","497d8b0b-bcbe-7eaa-1bbb-6541bb0ed65f","f6ff3acb-de2e-53f9-6fe3-a60d0c036f43"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"4 in a Row\" (also known as \"4 in a Line\" and \"Connect 4\") is a very challenging board game for all ages.
